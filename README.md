# FantasyFootballDashboard
This application will give the ability to see all of your fantasy football players in one place! Currently, we are planning on targeting three different services, but we may add others in the future:
* CBS Fantasy Football
* MyFantasyLeague
* ESPN Fantasy Football

The goal is to hook-up the API in this repo to a front-end project so that you can see how all of your players are doing on gameday.

## Test Harness Console Application
While we are working on developing the REST API, we've created a .NET Core console application so you can see how the connections work. As of Novembeer 3, 2020, you can use this console app to list out your players from CBS.
